## 📋 Overview

This is my personal portfolio, showcasing my projects, technical skills, education, and career goals as a Software Engineering student at PUC-Campinas. Designed and developed entirely by me, applying software engineering principles to a front-end project.

Access in: https://pedrotafner.github.io

## ✨ Features

- **Terminal typewriter effect** — animated hero that cycles through roles
- **Fully responsive** — mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
- **Smooth scroll navigation** with active section highlight

## 🛠️ Engineering Practices Applied

This project was built with software engineering principles in mind, not just as a visual exercise:

- **Separation of concerns** — structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behaviour (JS) are fully decoupled across separate files
- **Design token system** — all colors, spacing, typography, and shadows are defined as CSS Custom Properties in a single place, making the design easy to maintain and update
- **Modular JavaScript** — each feature (typewriter, navbar, hamburger menu, active nav, scroll animations) is encapsulated in its own IIFE module with no global scope pollution
- **Performance-first animations** — scroll-triggered effects use `IntersectionObserver` instead of `scroll` event listeners, avoiding layout thrashing
- **Accessibility** — `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `role` attributes, `:focus-visible` styles, and reduced-motion media query support throughout
- **Semantic HTML5** — correct use of `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<blockquote>`, and `<time>` elements
